Expenses Web Client
=================

Expeses Web Client is a simple SPA (Single Page Applcation) to allow human consumption of the data exposed by the ExpensesWEBService API. The application is built in Angular.js and makes use of Bootstrap CSS and Bower for dependencies management. This is not a fully functional production ready piece of software but rather my experiments to familiarize with Angular and generally the SPA concept.


The application allows to log into the service, list available expenses and edit a single expense. Addittionally users can create a new expense and delete an existing one.

Below are few screenshots of the application.

On a more narrow screen, such as on a mobile phone, the layout flows and adjusts to accomodate the screen size:
