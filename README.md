Expenses Web Client
=================

Expeses Web Client is a simple SPA to allow human consumption of the ExpensesWEBService API. The application is built in Angular.js and makes use of Bootstrap CSS and Bower for dependencies management.

The application allows to log into the service, list available expenses and edit a single expense. There is no provision, at the moment, for adding or deleting an epxense.

Below are few screenshots of the application.
